[The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html)
The Java Tutorials are practical guides for programmers who want to use the Java programming language to create applications. They include hundreds of complete, working examples, and dozens of lessons. Groups of related lessons are organized into "trails".

[University of Helsinki’s open online course (MOOC) on JAVA programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)  
The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II.


[Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3)
All good software starts with a great design. Object-oriented design helps developers plan applications before they write a single line of code, and break down ideas into reusable and maintainable components. This course focuses on the foundational concepts, teaching them in a fun, interactive way to help you quickly develop your skills. Tag team Olivia and Barron Stone introduce you to the concepts and terms—objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, and more—that you need to get started. They then show how to take the requirements for an app, identify use cases, and map out classes using Universal Modeling Language (UML). The final design can then be translated into code using one of the many popular object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, C#, Ruby, or Python.

[Foundations of Programming: Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-design-patterns-2?trk=lynda_redirect_learning)
Design patterns are reusable solutions that solve the challenges software developers face over and over again. Rather than reinventing the wheel, learn how to make use of these proven and tested patterns that will make your software more flexible and resilient to change. This course introduces you to design patterns and takes you through several of the most used object-oriented patterns. Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman, coauthors of Head First Design Patterns, join forces to provide an overview of each pattern and examples of the pattern in action. Featured design patterns include the Strategy, Adapter, Observer, and Decorator patterns. Elisabeth and Eric lend these concepts a real-world context by providing code demos in Java, with the occasional example in Python and JavaScript.
